# Wetlands_Artificial_Neural_Network_TCC

This repository of my undergraduate thesis of bachalerorÂ´s sanitary and environmental engineering from Federal University of Santa Catarina.

I've studied Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict Cemichal Oxygen Demand (COD) in a Satured Vertical Flow Constructed Wetland.

The results are validated through root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient regression (R2) adjusted coeffient regression (adjusted R2).

The ANN was developed using Keras, Numpy and Pandas, beside visualization libraries as Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
